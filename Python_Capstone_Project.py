# ## Data Story and Insights
# 
# 
# 
# 1. From the percentage distribution of employees across teams data analysis,
# it is observed, "New Orleans Pelicans" team has the highest percentage distribution of employees and
# "Minnesotta Timberwolves" team has the least percentage distribution of employees.
# Apart from very few teams, most of the teams have an equal percentage distribution of employees.
# 
# 
# 
# 

# 2. From the "distribution of employees by position" chart, it is observed, that most number of employees are working as "SG" role in the organization and least number of employees are working in the role "C". The most common position represents the majority workforce, showcasing the focus on specific roles.

# 3. From the age distribution of employees graph, it is observed the most frequent age group (e.g., "20-30") represents the majority workforce, indicating the general experience level of employees are young to middle-age level.

# 4. "The Salary expenditure by Team and Position" graph highlights salary expenditures across different teams and positions within the company. It is observed, teams like the Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors allocate significantly higher budgets across various positions, indicating a focus on retaining highly paid employees in critical roles. 
# Positions such as PF and SF often have the highest salaries, reflecting their importance in the company‚Äôs operational strategy. 
# In contrast, teams like Houston Rockets and Oklahoma City Thunder demonstrate more modest spending, possibly due to budget constraints or restructuring efforts. Balanced salary distributions, seen in teams like Miami Heat and Denver Nuggets, suggest a focus on maintaining well-rounded team structures. 
# Overall, the graph underscores how salary allocation reflects the company‚Äôs strategic priorities and workforce management approach.

# 5. The corelation between Age (x-axis) and Salary (y-axis) graph depicts, the relation between Age and Salary with a correlation coefficient 'ùëü' = 0.21. 
# It is observed that a corelation factor r=0.21 indicates a weak positive correlation between age and salary. As age increases, there is a slight tendency for salaries to increase, but the relationship is not strong.
